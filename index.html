            <h2>About</h2>
    
            <!-- <img src="Assets/images/placeimg_640_480_nature (1).jpg" alt="Wooded Landscape" style="width:260px;height:200px;" class="float-img"> -->
            <p>Currently I am a Project Manager II, with experience acting as a business analyst, for consumer packaged goods, medical and pharmaceutical clients.
                Prior to my current position I held a dual role as an administrator for SAP and the sole resource for managing the SAP MM module, used for purchasing goods and services globally.
                I have also worked as a help desk analyst.</p>
    
            <p>I have always loved technology and enjoyed jobs where that was my focus.  Learning and improving upon existing skills has also been of paramount importance.  
                I was able to combine both passions when I decided to learn full stack web development.</p>
    
            <p>My attention to detail, organizational skills, investment in learning and interpersonal skills have served me well in every position I have held.
                As an SAP administrator and MM module SME, I had unique insight into not only the system as a whole, but also end user processes.  
                This allowed me to troubleshoot, streamline specific functions and provide training to all users.</p>
    
            <p>As a current student learning full stack web development, I look forward to returning to my technology roots and transitioning into a new and rewarding career.</p>
