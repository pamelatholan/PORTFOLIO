## Redesign Portfolio
## HW 8

* Changed theme/color from original assignments, HW 1 Basic Portfolio and HW 2 Responsive Portfolio
* Used Bootstrap for my overall layout and Bootstrap card decks for project page layout
* Added links to LinkedIn, GitHub and resume
    * Both LinkedIn and my resume have my email and phone number which is why I did not display on the portfolio page
* Created and linked page for assignments and group projects completed thus far
    * All projects have link to deployed page and link to GitHub repo as well as a short description and image
    * All projects have updated README files with screen shots with the exception of Project 1 as I am not the owner of that repository
        * HW 3 Word Guess Game
        * HW 4 Unit 4 Game
        * HW 5 Trivia Game
        * HW 6 Giftastic
        * HW 7 Train Scheduler
        * Project 1 - Pamdora

#### Issues Encountered

* Most projects need to be redesigned to allow for mobile responsiveness
    * Difficult to accomplish in 1 week while also redesigning portfolio
* Originally had images of deployed pages in Bootstrap card decks on Projects page, but GitHub displayed 404 error
    * Images showed correctly on my local machine
    * Ended up replacing all images and that got rid of the 404 error on GitHub
        * Will attempt to update again at a later time, but wanted project to be in working order when turning in for grading
* Unable to update README for Project 1 as I am not the repository owner
    * Will most likely end up creating new repository so I can continue to improve upon the project
